\title{SLC Engine for Quarto}
\usage{
slc_engine(options)
}
\arguments{
\item{options}{A list of chunk options from knitr, including:
\describe{
\item{code}{Character vector containing the SLC code to execute}
\item{input_data}{Name of R data.frame to make available in SLC (optional)}
\item{output_data}{Name for capturing SLC output data into R (optional)}
\item{eval}{Whether to evaluate the code (default: TRUE)}
\item{echo}{Whether to show the code (default: TRUE)}
\item{include}{Whether to include output (default: TRUE)}
}}
}
\value{
A knitr engine output object containing the code and results
}
\description{
Provides support for executing SLC code blocks in Quarto documents.
This function is automatically called by knitr when processing SLC code chunks.
}
\details{
This function handles the execution of SLC code within Quarto documents by:
\itemize{
\item Initializing SLC connection if needed
\item Transferring input data from R to SLC if specified
\item Executing the SLC code
\item Capturing output and logs
\item Transferring output data from SLC to R if specified
}

When \code{output_data} is specified, the function assigns the resulting
data frame to the global environment using \code{assign()}. This is intentional
behavior to make SLC output data available for subsequent R code chunks in
Quarto documents.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# This function is typically called automatically by knitr
# when processing SLC code chunks in Quarto documents

# Example chunk options that would be passed:
options <- list(
  code = c("data test;", "  x = 1;", "run;"),
  input_data = "mtcars",
  output_data = "results",
  eval = TRUE,
  echo = TRUE
)

# The engine would be called like this:
# slc_engine(options)
}
}
